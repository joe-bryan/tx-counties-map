# Texas Counties interactive map
Plots a choropleth of the Texas counties (just outline, no color). Each of the 5 metro areas below highlights each county with color representing 
average unemployment in that metro area county. The function outputs an interactive map of Texas counties in the specified year. In addition, a hover tool displays: the metro area name, county names, unemployment, and workforce. The unemployment rate is from 2009. This is passion project that I care about since I'm from Texas, and I love maps!
